# AWS Kinesis Overview
* Kinesis is a managed alternative to Apache Kafka
* Great for applicaiton logs, metrics, Iot, clickstreams
* Great for 'real-time' big data.
* Great for streaming processing frameworks (Spark, NiFi, etc)
* Data is automatically replicated synchronously to 3 AZ.
* Kinesis Streams: Low latency streaming ingest at scale
* Kinasys Analytics: Perform real-time analytics on streams using SQL.

_Image_Goes_Here_
* Data retention is 24 hours by defaults. Can go up to 7 days.
* Ability ti reprocess / replay data.
* Multiple applications can consume the same stream.
* Real-Time processing with scale of throughput.
* Once data is inserted in Kinesis, it cannot be deleted (immutability).

# Todo

- [x] This is an example of a todo list item that's complete
- [x] Todo lists are useful for keeping organised and focused
- [ ] This one is not completed yet
- [ ] You can mark it completed by pressing `Option`+`C` (or `Alt`+`C`) when your cursor is on this line
  - [ ] You can also select multiple lines and mark them all at once!
- [ ] When you press enter at the end of a line, it adds a new todo item on the next line
- [ ] This, and more is provided by the [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) plugin by [Yu Zhang](https://github.com/yzhang-gh)

# This is how scratch works for them.

- Here you can write disorganised notes to be categorised later
- Bullet points are useful, but it could be free form text as well
- Sometimes it's better to just get things off your mind quickly, rather than stop to think where it belongs
- But don't let this list get too long
- Move information to more specific documents and link to them.
  - This helps you navigate between documents quickly
  - For example, you can `Cmd`+`Click` this: [[todo]]
- Some notes don't end up making sense the next day
- That's ok, you can just delete them!
  - You can always find them in your git history, if you really need it!
