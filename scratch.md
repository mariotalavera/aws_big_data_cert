## Todo

- [x] This is an example of a todo list item that's complete
- [x] Todo lists are useful for keeping organised and focused
- [ ] This one is not completed yet
- [ ] You can mark it completed by pressing `Option`+`C` (or `Alt`+`C`) when your cursor is on this line
  - [ ] You can also select multiple lines and mark them all at once!
- [ ] When you press enter at the end of a line, it adds a new todo item on the next line
- [ ] This, and more is provided by the [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) plugin by [Yu Zhang](https://github.com/yzhang-gh)

## This is how scratch works for them.

- Here you can write disorganised notes to be categorised later
- Bullet points are useful, but it could be free form text as well
- Sometimes it's better to just get things off your mind quickly, rather than stop to think where it belongs
- But don't let this list get too long
* Move information to more specific documents and link to them.
  * This helps you navigate between documents quickly
  * For example, you can `Cmd`+`Click` this: [[todo]]
- Some notes don't end up making sense the next day
- That's ok, you can just delete them!
  - You can always find them in your git history, if you really need it!
